# Better OpCodes generated by ChatGPT

To store the type of each instruction and its argument types and count in a structured way, you can use a combination of data structures. A common approach is to use a `struct` or a `class` to define the properties of each instruction, and then use a map or array to associate each `OpCode` with its corresponding properties.

Here's an example of how you might do this in C++:

1. **Define a Structure for Instruction Properties**:

    ```cpp
    struct InstructionProperties {
        int argumentCount;
        std::vector<std::string> argumentTypes; // Or use an enum for type safety
        // You can add more properties here if needed
    };
    ```

2. **Create a Map or Array to Store Instruction Properties**:

    You can create a map (or an array if performance is a concern and the opcodes are densely packed) to associate each `OpCode` with its `InstructionProperties`.

    ```cpp
    std::map<OpCode, InstructionProperties> instructionSet;
    ```

3. **Initialize the Map with Instruction Properties**:

    Populate the map with the properties of each instruction. This initialization can be done statically or in the constructor of a class responsible for managing instructions.

    ```cpp
    instructionSet[HALT] = {0, {}};
    instructionSet[PUSH_LIT] = {1, {"Literal"}};
    instructionSet[PUSH_REG] = {1, {"Register"}};
    instructionSet[POP_REG] = {1, {"Register"}};
    // ... and so on for other instructions
    ```

4. **Usage**:

    When you need to get the properties of an instruction, you can simply look it up in the map:

    ```cpp
    OpCode op = PUSH_LIT;
    InstructionProperties props = instructionSet[op];

    std::cout << "Argument count: " << props.argumentCount << std::endl;
    for (const auto& type : props.argumentTypes) {
        std::cout << "Argument type: " << type << std::endl;
    }
    ```

5. **Type Safety and Extensibility**:

    - Consider using an `enum` or `enum class` for argument types for type safety.
    - This approach is easily extensible. If you need to add more properties to an instruction (like whether it's a jump instruction, its byte size, etc.), you can simply add more fields to the `InstructionProperties` struct.

This method gives you a flexible, centralized way to define and query the properties of your instructions, making it easier to manage and extend your instruction set.
