# Object File TODO generated by ChatGPT

When designing a header for an object file in the context of assembly language and linking, you can include several pieces of information that are crucial for the linking process. Here's an overview of what you might include in your object file header:

1. **Magic Number or Signature**: A specific set of bytes that identifies the file as an object file. This is useful for tools to quickly verify the file type.

2. **Version Information**: Information about the version of the file format or the assembler used. This can help ensure compatibility during linking.

3. **Architecture or Platform Information**: Specifies the target architecture (e.g., x86, ARM) for which the object file's code is compiled. This is essential for the linker to correctly interpret the machine code.

4. **Symbol Table**: A list of symbols (labels, function names, global variables) that are defined (exported) in this object file. Each entry typically includes:
   - Symbol name.
   - Symbol type (function, global variable, etc.).
   - The address or offset within the object file.
   - Additional attributes (like visibility - public or private).

5. **Relocation Information**: A list of places in the code or data sections that need to be fixed up by the linker. This includes addresses that depend on the final layout of the executable. Each entry might contain:
   - The address of the item to be relocated.
   - The type of relocation required.
   - The symbol it relates to (if applicable).

6. **Unresolved Symbols Table**: A list of external symbols that the object file refers to but doesn't define. These need to be resolved by the linker. Each entry usually includes:
   - The name of the symbol.
   - The location within the object file that refers to this symbol.

7. **Section Headers**: Information about the different sections of the object file, like the code section, data section, BSS section (uninitialized data), etc. Each section header might include the section size, location, and type.

8. **File Size and Checksums**: Information about the size of the object file and possibly checksums or hashes for integrity verification.

9. **Debugging Information**: If the object file includes debugging information (like line numbers, file names), this could be part of the header or a separate section referenced by the header.

10. **Optional Information**: Any additional information relevant to the object file, like compiler flags used, optimization levels, or custom metadata for specific use cases.

This structured approach to creating an object file header allows the linker to efficiently process and link multiple object files, resolving symbols and relocation entries as needed to create a final executable. It also provides valuable information for debugging and troubleshooting during the software development process.
